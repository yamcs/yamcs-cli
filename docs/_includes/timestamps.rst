When parsing timestamps, yamcs-cli accepts a specification in ISO format. The following special patterns are also recognised:

* ``now``: current time
* ``now UTC``: current UTC time
* ``today``: 00:00:00 of the current day
* ``today UTC``: 00:00:00 UTC of the current day
* ``yesterday``: 00:00:00 of the day before
* ``yesterday UTC``: 00:00:00 UTC of the day before
* ``tomorrow``: 00:00:00 of the next day
* ``tomorrow UTC``: 00:00:00 UTC of the next day
